### How to run locally:

1. Clone the repo with:

    `git clone https://github.com/ktheriault/metaweather`

2. Install React packages with:

    `npm install`

    You may also have to install Node or NPM.

3. Build the frontend with:

    `npm run build`

4. Run the backend with:

    `node server.js`

    This keeps running in the Terminal.

5. The web page is at http://localhost:8080/.

### How to see the web page live:

1. Go to https://jobcase-metaweather.herokuapp.com/.

### Design decisions

I am running through an Express server because the Metaweather API doesn't allow CORS.
